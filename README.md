# WFHelper

Unofficial Warframe companion app for Windows and Linux. It reads your
inventory, prices it with live warframe.market data, scans relic rewards on
screen and tracks your arbitration runs straight from EE.log.

## Features

In the app:

- Inventory: your whole account with platinum prices, order books and an
  equipment tab for weapons and frames
- Relics: the relics you own with their contents, drop sources and rewards
- Foundry: crafting requirements down to every component
- Mastery: what you have not mastered yet, and what you could build
- Rivens: your rivens compared with the market, plus a riven finder
- Builds (beta): suggests primary and secondary weapon builds from your owned
  mods and damage arcanes, with saved-config comparisons and estimated target
  damage. Validate recommendations in-game; some mechanics are not modelled
- Market: manage your warframe.market orders in the app (sign-in optional)
- Arbitrations: each run analyzed from EE.log (kills, drones, rotations and
  vitus luck against the expected drop rates), plus the schedule with desktop
  notifications for favorited nodes
- World: cycles, fissures, invasions, bounties and circuit rotations
- Stats: daily platinum, credits and endo, plus your trade history
- Wiki: item drop locations and relic reward tables
- Themes: preset looks, or build your own

In-game overlays (Warframe in Borderless mode):

- Relic rewards: prices every reward when your squad's relics crack
- Relic planner: ranks the relics you own on the relic selection screen
- Riven scanner: reads the rolls and compares old and new stats while you reroll
- Arbitration summary: your run stats as soon as the mission ends

Notifications: in-game whispers, warframe.market DMs and arbitration windows can
show desktop notifications while you play.

> **Set Warframe's interface language to English.** Relic and riven scans only
> read English item names. WFHelper's own display language is separate and can
> be changed in Settings.

## Install

Download the latest `WFHelper-<version>-Setup.exe` from
[Releases](https://github.com/WFHelper/WFHelper/releases) and run it.

Windows SmartScreen may warn you the first time because the installer is not
code-signed: click "More info", then "Run anyway".

### Linux

Download `WFHelper-<version>.AppImage` from
[Releases](https://github.com/WFHelper/WFHelper/releases), make it executable
and run it:

```
chmod +x WFHelper-*.AppImage
./WFHelper-*.AppImage
```

In a file manager instead: right-click the file, open Properties, then
Permissions, tick "Allow executing as program" and double-click it.

Good to know:

- **Warframe runs through Steam (Proton), Heroic, Lutris, Bottles or Wine.**
  WFHelper finds the game's log on its own, including Flatpak installs and
  Snap Steam.
- **Inventory comes straight from the running game.** Nothing extra to
  download on Linux.
- **Wayland picks its own backend.** The app puts itself on XWayland so the overlays
  can sit on top of the game. Compositors without a real XWayland (niri) show
  no window at all, so WFHelper notices, restarts on native Wayland and
  remembers it. Settings lets you pick the backend by hand. Wayland gives no
  app a way to force itself above another, so overlays are best-effort there.
- **Native Wayland has no global hotkeys.** The overlay unlock key never fires
  there, so use "Switch to interactive overlays" in Settings > Overlays, or bind
  `--toggle-overlay-interaction` to a key in your compositor. In niri:
  `Mod+I { spawn "/path/to/WFHelper.AppImage" "--toggle-overlay-interaction"; }`
- **SteamOS is untested.** Desktop mode may work like any other distro. Game
  mode is not supported: gamescope only displays the game it launched, so
  forcing the app into it can freeze the session.
- **Screen capture:** on sway, Hyprland, river and niri, WFHelper copies the
  screen straight from the compositor with no dialog, also under XWayland. On
  GNOME, KDE Plasma and COSMIC the first overlay scan opens the screen-share
  dialog once per session. Pick the monitor Warframe runs on.
- **On Steam, instant overlays need one launch option.** Add
  `PROTON_LOG=1 %command%` to Warframe's launch options (right-click Warframe,
  Properties, Launch Options) and restart the game. The setup wizard shows the same string
  with a copy button. Without it the overlays still fire, just a few seconds
  later.

### Linux requirements

- **AppImage on Ubuntu 24.04 or newer:** install `libfuse2t64` and start the
  AppImage with `--no-sandbox` (Ubuntu's AppArmor blocks Electron's sandbox).
- **Inventory from the running game and mission tracking:** both read the
  game's memory, which Ubuntu, Arch and many other distributions block by
  default (`kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=1`). Allow it until the next reboot with
  `sudo sysctl kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0`, or keep it with
  `echo 'kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-ptrace.conf`
  followed by `sudo sysctl --system`. This lets any program you run read the
  memory of your other programs. If you would rather not allow that, use the
  JSON or AlecaFrame import.
- **Reward and planner scans:**
  - sway, Hyprland, river and niri: nothing to install and no dialog, also
    under XWayland. WFHelper copies the screen straight from the compositor.
    If you turned on Hyprland's permission prompts, allow screen copy for
    WFHelper.
  - GNOME, KDE Plasma and COSMIC: scans go through the desktop's screen-share
    portal. Install `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` (GNOME), `xdg-desktop-portal-kde`
    (KDE Plasma) or `xdg-desktop-portal-cosmic` (COSMIC) and log out and back
    in. To check it, start a PipeWire screen capture in OBS or share your
    screen in a browser: a share dialog should open. **Settings > Overlays >
    Set up screen capture** opens that dialog before you play, so it does not
    hide behind the game on the first reward screen.
  - GNOME has no layer-shell overlays, so keep WFHelper on XWayland there.
  - On an X11 session there is no dialog and nothing to install.
- **Saving your warframe.market login needs a keyring:** gnome-keyring, KWallet
  or KeePassXC with Secret Service turned on. WFHelper uses it on its own when
  one is running. If you still have to sign in after every restart, start
  WFHelper with `--password-store=gnome-libsecret` (or
  `--password-store=kwallet6` on KDE).

### Inventory data

The game has no local inventory API, so the first-run wizard offers three
sources:

- warframe-api-helper (recommended): on Windows it downloads
  [Sainan/warframe-api-helper](https://github.com/Sainan/warframe-api-helper)
  and loads its `inventory.json` snapshots while you play. On Linux this option
  is called "Read from the running game": WFHelper takes the login token from
  the running game and downloads your inventory itself
- JSON import: open an `inventory.json` export you already have
- AlecaFrame import: decrypts AlecaFrame's local `lastData.dat` cache

You can also pick "Continue without inventory". World, the warframe.market
features and the relic reward, riven and arbitration overlays work without
one. Everything based on what you own (owned counts, the relic planner,
Foundry, Mastery) needs an inventory, which you can connect later in Settings.

Only the recommended helper ("Read from the running game" on Linux) and the
optional mission tracking read the game's memory. The JSON and AlecaFrame
imports and the overlays never do.

## Privacy

Inventory snapshots, captured arbitration logs and stats stay on your PC. The
app talks to its own caching backend for warframe.market prices, icons and new
relic data, to the public game-data sources listed below, and to GitHub for
updates. The app has no crash reporting or telemetry. Each backend request
leaves a record of its route, status, timing and item slug in Cloudflare and
Grafana, and the backend keeps an anonymous count of daily active users.
The installed app checks for updates when it starts and every 6 hours; you
choose when to download and install one.

## Building from source

You need Node 22.12 or newer and pnpm 11 (through corepack).

```
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run dev        # run in development
pnpm run dist:win   # build the Windows installer (NSIS)
```
